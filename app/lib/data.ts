      history: `The site of the Cittadella (also called the Castello or Gran Castello) has been inhabited and fortified since at least the Bronze Age (~1500 BC). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} 
Over time it served as the acropolis of the Punic-Roman city of Gaulos (or Glauconis Civitas). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} 
In medieval times, a castle structure was built on this hill, and the local population used it as a refuge during raids. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} 
However, by the mid-16th century its medieval defences were obsolete. In July 1551, an Ottoman force invaded Gozo; the Cittadella fell quickly, and thousands of Gozitans were taken into slavery. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} 
Afterwards, from 1599 to 1622, the southern walls were rebuilt in bastioned form (Italian style) to modernise the fortress under the Knights of St John. The engineer Giovanni Rinaldini was involved. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} 
The northern medieval walls were largely preserved. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} 
Under subsequent rule (French, British), the fortress saw few major military actions, and it was decommissioned as a military installation on 1 April 1868. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} 
In the 21st century, two major restoration programmes (2006-2008, and 2014-2016) stabilised the ramparts, cleared archaeological deposits (Bronze Age silos, circular stones) and reopened new visitor routes. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}`,

      architecture: `The present fortification is a mix of medieval elements (mostly in the northern section) and early 17th-century bastioned enceinte (“alla Italiana”) replacing the older southern walls. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} 
The new enceinte includes a central bastion, connecting curtain walls, demi-bastions, and small cavaliers. Externally it had a ditch, covertway, and steep glacis (though today only remnants remain). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} 
The fortress is built in local limestone; many structural elements have suffered erosion over time, requiring careful restoration. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} 
Within the walls are narrow streets, alleys, small chapels, niches, reliefs, and Norman-style windows/arches in older structures. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} 
One point of note: the visitor centre is housed in a former water reservoir beneath the fortifications. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}`,

      highlights: `From its ramparts one gets sweeping panoramic views over Victoria, rural Gozo and the surrounding countryside. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} 
Notable points inside include the Cathedral of the Assumption (built 1697–1711) in the main piazza. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14} 
You can visit multiple small museums within the Cittadella: Gozo Museum of Archaeology, Old Prison, Gran Castello Historic House, Gozo Nature Museum, and the Visitors’ Centre. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15} 
Walking the ramparts, exploring hidden alleys, and finding carved coats-of-arms or inscriptions is part of the charm. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} 
Also, the “1551 Monument” (commemorating the Ottoman raid) stands near the entrance. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}`,

      visitorTips: `The Cittadella is car-free; vehicles can’t enter its narrow lanes. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18} 
There is a car park just outside the walls. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} 
Part of the site is accessible for persons with disability. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} 
Entrance to the Cittadella is free, but individual museums (e.g. Archaeology, Old Prison) require a ticket or a “combo” pass. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} 
Allow at least 1.5–2 hours (or more) to explore fully. 
Check for opening hours (some parts close earlier). 
Bring water, sun protection (many exposed ramparts). 
Don’t miss sunset views — the fortress is dramatic at dusk.`,

      history: `The parish of St George in Victoria (also known in Maltese as San Ġorġ) is ancient, with evidence of a Christian community there from at least the early centuries AD. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22} 
The site is believed to have originally hosted a pagan Roman temple, which was later converted to a Christian church. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23} 
Over the centuries the church was rebuilt multiple times. In 1511 the church was affirmed as the parish church of Gozo. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24} 
The present Baroque building’s foundation stone was laid in 1672, and the church was completed in 1678. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25} 
In 1958 it was granted the title of Basilica; later, in 1976, it became an archipresbyteral/collegiate church aggregated to the Lateran Basilica in Rome. :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26} 
In 2013, a new museum “Heart of Gozo: Il-Hagar” opened adjacent to the basilica, showcasing historical and artistic artifacts connected to the parish. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}`,

      architecture: `It is often referred to as the “Marble Basilica” since large parts of its interior are covered in marble. :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28} 
The façade is grand, flanked by twin bell towers, with a monumental portal. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29} 
The ceiling and dome paintings were done by Giovanni Battista Conti of Rome. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30} 
The interior is enriched with works by distinguished Maltese and foreign artists: Mattia Preti, Giuseppe Calì, Michele Busuttil, Giuseppe Fenech, Francesco Zahra, Fortunato Venuti, Injazju Cortis, Ramiro Calì, Filippo Cosimo, Giuseppe d’Arena, Salvatore Bondì, Roberto Dingli, and Stefano Erardi. :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31} 
There is an imposing gilded bronze canopy over the high altar. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32} 
The statue of St George (on horseback) was carved from wood by Pawlu (Pietro Paolo) Azzopardi in 1838, and is significant for being the first titular statue owned by a parish church in Gozo. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}`,

      highlights: `Admire the dome and ceiling frescoes by Conti; the illusionistic “trompe-l’œil” effect is striking. 
The main altar with its gilded canopy is a visual centerpiece. 
The titular wooden statue of St George is a prized work. 
Check the Il-Hagar Museum (if open) for parish artifacts and history. 
The basilica dominates St George’s Square and forms a visual anchor for the town. :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}`,

      visitorTips: `Entry may be subject to religious services — check times. 
Appropriate dress is required (shoulders and knees covered) as it is an active church. 
Photography may be restricted — check signage or local rules. 
Allow 20–30 minutes (or more) if also visiting Il-Hagar museum. 
You’ll often encounter locals and quiet prayer times, so move respectfully.`,

Its name “Independence Square” reflects Malta’s independence and is part of the civic identity of Victoria. 
The square has been the site of street markets, open-air events, and public festivities through time. :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}`,

      architecture: `It is a modest open urban plaza, paved, surrounded by historic façades, cafés, shops, and narrow alleys. 
The design is simple — it’s not a grand baroque square but a functional, human-scale urban node. 
Its visual anchor is the façade of the Basilica across one side. :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}`,

      highlights: `Watch local life — vendors, markets, foot traffic. 
Sit at a café and enjoy people-watching with the Basilica as a backdrop. 
Notice the small side alleys branching off to hidden old streets. 
Events, small concerts or exhibitions may pop up here. 
Because it’s central, it forms a transition point between the lower town and the ascent toward the Cittadella.`,

      visitorTips: `It’s always open (public square). 
Good spot to pause when exploring Victoria. 
Be careful with cafés — sometimes tourist markups.

Originally, the area had been used as an experimental government farm. :contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39} 
In later years, the gardens underwent refurbishment and restoration (notably a renewal around 2012). :contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}`,

      architecture: `The garden lies on the lower end of Republic Street (Triq ir-Repubblika), between the street and the main car park / bus terminus. :contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}

      highlights: `Relax in shade under trees, enjoy a quiet moment away from streets.

Look (and press) the musical benches for an interactive audio experience. :contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47} 
The layout and diagonal paths are interesting to spot from above. 
It’s a quiet escape even though close to Victoria’s bustle. 
Because it’s elevated slightly, you may get views of surrounding rooftops too.`,

      visitorTips: `Free entry, always open. 
Because it is adjacent to Republic Street, you might pass it en route to/from other sites. 
Good place for a rest, picnic, or reading. 
Be cautious of sun in midday — parts are open and not heavily shaded.

      architecture: `The prison comprises narrow cells and corridors. The walls are thick limestone and the spatial layout is stark and confined. 
Because of its age, some walls have been substantially restored; visitor access is controlled to limit damage. 
Many of the graffiti remain visible in situ, carefully preserved behind protective barriers. :contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}`,

      highlights: `The graffiti collection is the largest single collection of historical graffiti in the Maltese Islands. :contentReference[oaicite:53]{index=53}
