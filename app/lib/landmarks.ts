      history:
        "Archaeological evidence shows the site was inhabited and fortified from at least around 1500 BC. It later evolved into the acropolis of the Roman-era municipality of Gaulos/Glauconis Civitas. During the medieval period, the hilltop was enclosed in castle walls; by the mid-16th century, the defences were antiquated and in July 1551 the Ottomans captured Gozo after sacking the Cittadella. From 1599-1622, the southern walls were rebuilt in the Italian bastioned style under the Knights of St John. Over time the military importance waned, and today it is preserved as a historic monument.",
      architecture:
        "The present fortifications combine medieval wall sections (especially on the north) with early-17th-century bastioned defences (“alla Italiana”) around the southern perimeter. Built of local limestone, the complex features bastions, demi-bastions, curtain walls, glacis and a dry ditch (though some elements are eroded or altered). Inside the walls you’ll find narrow alleys, an old cathedral, small museums and relics of former military and civic life.",
      highlights:
        "• Extraordinary panoramic views of Gozo and the surrounding countryside from the ramparts.\n• The hilltop cathedral anchors the piazza, plus several small museums and historical displays.\n• The fortress layout invites exploration of its mixed heritage (ancient settlement → medieval refuge → early modern fortress).",
      visitorTips:
        "Entry to the Cittadella is free; individual museums require separate tickets. You should allow 1.5–2 hours or more to explore fully. The site is largely car-free; park outside the walls. Bring water and sun protection (many ramparts are exposed). Visit near sunset for dramatic lighting and fewer crowds.",

    description:
      "A stunning Baroque church with richly decorated interior, centrally located in Victoria (Ir-Rabat) on Gozo. Known locally for its marble finishes, gilding and religious significance—it stands as one of the island’s premier architectural and artistic landmarks.",

    info: {
      history:
        "The parish dedicated to St George dates at least to the early Middle Ages, with evidence of a Christian community from the 13th or 14th century. The current basilica’s foundation stone was laid in 1672 and the church was completed by 1678. In 1958 it was elevated to the rank of minor basilica, and in 1976 became a collegiate church affiliated with the Lateran Basilica in Rome.",
      architecture:
        "The façade is grand and flanked by twin bell towers; the interior is lavishly finished in marble throughout (earning it the nickname “Marble Basilica”). The ceiling and dome feature significant painting works and the main altar is capped by a gilded bronze canopy. A key work is a wooden statue of St George carved in 1838—the first titular statue in Gozo.",
      highlights:
        "• The central altarpiece by Mattia Preti depicting St George on horseback.\n• The wooden statue of St George, carried in the annual festa procession.\n• The richness of marble and gilded decoration inside the basilica.\n• The setting in St George’s Square, with cafés and old streets around it.",
      visitorTips:
        "This is an active parish church—mass and services take place, so check times if you want quieter access. Dress modestly (shoulders and knees covered) and photography may be restricted. A quick visit takes ~20–30 minutes if you don’t explore all nooks. Early morning or later afternoon visits offer softer light and fewer crowds.",

    info: {
      history:
        "This square, called It-Tokk in Maltese, has long been a gathering place in Victoria (Ir-Rabat), especially because of its closeness to St George’s Basilica and key public routes. Its name “Independence Square” reflects Malta’s independence and is part of the civic identity of Victoria. The square has hosted street markets, open-air events and public festivities over time.",
      architecture:
        "It is a modest open urban plaza, paved, surrounded by historic façades, cafés, shops, and narrow alleys. The design is simple—more functional than grand—its visual anchor is the façade of the Basilica across one side.",
      highlights:
        "• Watch local life—vendors, markets, foot traffic.\n• Sit at a café and enjoy people-watching with the Basilica as a backdrop.\n• Notice the small side alleys branching off to hidden old streets.\n• Because it’s central, it forms a transition point between the lower town and the ascent toward the Cittadella.",
      visitorTips:
        "It’s always open (public square). Good spot to pause when exploring Victoria. Be careful with cafés—sometimes tourist mark-ups. Use this as a navigation hub: many streets radiate from here into old Victoria.",

      history:
        "The gardens were laid out under British Governor General Leslie Rundle around 1915. Originally the area had been used as an experimental government farm. Over the years the gardens have been refurbished and restored for public use.",
      architecture:
        "The garden lies on the lower end of Republic Street in Victoria, between the street and the main car-park/bus terminus. It features a mix of native and imported trees (such as Ficus nitida, Canary palms) and includes a layout originally designed in the diagonal flag (Union Jack) pattern—still traceable today. Six interactive “musical benches” have been added where visitors can listen to recordings of Maltese music.",
      highlights:
        "• Relax under shade beneath trees, enjoy a quiet moment away from the busy streets.\n• Check out the busts and memorials of local figures.\n• Press the musical-bench buttons for an audio-heritage experience.\n• Its small elevation gives views of surrounding rooftops and it’s still central to Victoria’s bustle.",
      visitorTips:
        "Free entry, always open. Because it is adjacent to Republic Street, you might pass it en route to/from other sites. Best for a rest, picnic or leisurely stroll. Some parts are open to the sun—bring shade if midday. Near the gardens is the main car park and bus terminus, convenient for switching modes.",

      history:
        "The Old Prison (Il-Priġun ta’ Ġawds) is one of the oldest surviving prison buildings in Gozo. It was used from the mid-16th century until 1962. Many inmates left carvings and graffiti—names, ships, hands, symbols—etched into the limestone walls.",
      architecture:
        "The prison comprises narrow cells, corridors and thick limestone walls. The spatial layout is stark and confined by design. Because of its age, some walls have been restored; many of the original graffiti remain visible behind protective barriers.",
      highlights:
        "• The graffiti collection is one of the largest historical assemblages in the Maltese Islands.\n• You can view carved names, drawings, game-boards, sailing vessels, religious symbols and more.\n• It offers a visceral sense of the conditions and mindset of past inmates.\n• Often included in the Cittadella museum circuit.",
      visitorTips:
        "Access is via the Cittadella, usually with a museum ticket or combined pass. The prison is indoors (dimmer light)—bring a flashlight app or use ambient light. Take time to inspect and don’t rush. Some parts may be narrow or have low ceilings—watch your head.",

      history:
        "The Gozo Museum of Archaeology (originally the Gozo Museum) was inaugurated in May 1960 in a 17th-century townhouse behind the gateway to the Cittadella. It was reorganised in 1986 to focus exclusively on archaeology and early history of Gozo.",
      architecture:
        "The museum is housed in a symmetrical two-storey townhouse (Casa Bondì) with a carved stone balcony above its front door. The building is modest in footprint but cleverly arranged into thematic galleries displaying Prehistory, Classical (Phoenician/Punic/Roman) and Medieval/Early Modern artefacts.",
      highlights:
        "• Prehistoric displays cover daily life, subsistence and burial customs.\n• Classical period artefacts include coins, statuary, pottery and decorative elements.\n• A key artefact is the Majmuna Stone—an Arabic-inscribed tombstone dating to 1173, found in Gozo.\n• The museum is small but dense—a compact window into Gozo’s full span of human occupation.",
      visitorTips:
        "The museum is part of the Cittadella museum circuit; a combo ticket often gives access to several museums including this one. Opening hours vary—check locally. Entry fees apply (student/senior discounts may be available). Expect to spend ~20-30 minutes (or more) depending on interest. Photography may be allowed but avoid flash for delicate objects.",

      history:
        "The site has been sacred for millennia—originally a Roman temple, later a medieval church on the same location. The present Baroque cathedral was built from 1697 to 1711, designed by architect Lorenzo Gafà. It was consecrated on 11 October 1716 and has been the seat of the Diocese of Gozo since its establishment in 1864.",
      architecture:
        "The cathedral is Baroque in style and built entirely of local limestone. Its ground plan is a Latin cross. Although a full dome was not built, the ceiling features a trompe-l’œil illusion of a dome. The façade draws inspiration from the Church of the Gesù in Rome and the interior is richly decorated with frescoes, pilasters and tall windows.",
      highlights:
        "• The trompe-l’œil dome is a highlight—an optical illusion creating the impression of a full dome.\n• Rich artworks: paintings, sculptures and carved details inside.\n• The Cathedral Museum (behind the church) houses religious artefacts and communal treasures.\n• From the steps you get striking views of the inner fortress alleys and outer ramparts.",
      visitorTips:
        "This is an active cathedral—mass and liturgical services take place, so visit outside service times for quiet. Modest dress is required (shoulders and knees covered). Check museum opening hours if you want to visit the museum behind the cathedral. Photography may be restricted in certain areas. Even if you don’t enter, the façade and square are photogenic. Spend approx. 15-25 minutes inside if you intend to see the museum as well.",

Over the years it became the commercial spine of the town—shops, arcades, banks, cafés, services. The name “Republic Street” reflects post-independence naming. It also links many of Victoria’s principal landmarks: Independence Square, Villa Rundle Gardens, etc.",
      architecture:
        "The street is lined with traditional Maltese/Gozitan limestone façades, shops and small arcades. You’ll see banks, pharmacies, local artisan shops, cafés, the opera theatres (Astra, Aurora). The street is pedestrian-friendly, though motor traffic may pass in certain zones. It slopes gently in parts, especially near the upper end toward the Cittadella.",

      visitorTips:
        "This is public and always open (as a street). Wear comfortable shoes—you may walk a lot. Best explored on foot. Using Republic Street you can access many landmarks sequentially. Be aware of peak business hours: some shops may close mid-afternoon.",
